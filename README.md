# FoodManJones
A site to browse and share recipes

An **outdated and functionally incomplete** version is hosted at https://foodmanjones.vercel.app/. As our app is designed to run on a single server and Vercel is a serverless hosting solution, it lacks important features like the recommendation algorithm, image upload, bug fixes, and all the imported data.

## usage
It's run just like any Django app:

- For development use, simply go to the project directory, and run the command `python recipeapp/manage.py runserver`.

- For production use, please deploy using the WSGI file.

## license
idk
